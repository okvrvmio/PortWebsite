# How to Obtain Data used for this project!

Unfortunately the dataset I used for this project was too large (even when I tried to upload it as a .zip). Below I will provide instruction on where you can go to download the data sets. I will also be looking into 'Git Large File Storage' as a remedy to this issue, but until then please follow these step! 

1. The Data was downloaded from Kaggle. Copy and paste this URL into your Browser to get to the Kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles

2. Download both `Accident_Information.csv` and `Vehicle_Information.csv` from the Kaggle page and rename both files to `accident` and `vehicle` respectively.

3. Once the renamed data sets are in the same directory as the `DataCleaning` jupyter notebook you are all set to go! By the end of the notebook you should have two new data set called `acc_cleaned` and `veh_cleaned`
